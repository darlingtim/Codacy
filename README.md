# Codacy
Repository with all the configuration files for Wordpress, Laravel and React projects to work with [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/).

Codacy is an automated code reviewer to monitor the code quality over time. This covers static analysis, code coverage and metrics for many languages.

Codacy has a set of predefined rules and code patterns. However to keep the company's code standards unified, we defined some custom configuration files so Codacy can review our code against these custom rules and code patterns, depending on the language/framework/technology.

See the README file in each folder to follow instructions on how to make it work and which dependencies need to be installed for each case.
